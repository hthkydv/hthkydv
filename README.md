My academic background in Electronics and Communication Engineering (IES College of Technology, Bhopal) empowers me to approach challenges with a technical mindset. Constantly seeking to enhance my skillset, I've actively participated in hackathons like Kawach Cybersecurity Hackathon (2023), Volunteer International Science Fest (2022), and Smart India Hackathon (2022), where my team placed among the top 5.
